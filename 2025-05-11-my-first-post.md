This was one of the first CTF-style rooms I completed on TryHackMe. It focused on exploiting an old version of SMB and taught me how to use Nmap, enum4linux, and Metasploit.

**What I Learned:**
- How to enumerate open SMB shares
- How to exploit EternalBlue using Metasploit
- How to manually extract flags and maintain access

I also documented the steps and included screenshots [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/yourusername/thm-writeups).
